# Product Vision

**Name:** NetCrab

**Tagline (working):**

> NetCrab scuttles through your network, scoops up "junk" behavior data, and sells it back as clean, ethical product intelligence.

**Mascot:** A small hermit crab using an old beige computer tower (or CRT monitor) as a shell. Expression: curious and focused, not goofy. Good for B2B decks.

## Core Idea

Inside every intranet/product, there's a constant exhaust of:

* clicks
* scrolls
* focus changes
* rage-clicks and backtracks
* task start/end events

Most of it is thrown away or buried in one product's logs.

**NetCrab:**

1. **Collects** that behavioral exhaust via lightweight SDKs + an on-prem agent.

2. **Normalizes & analyzes** it (heuristics + ML + LLM summarization).

3. **Feeds it back** to the product owner as a **Frustration & Efficiency Map**.

4. **Aggregates & anonymizes** cross-customer patterns into **sellable data packs**:

   * UX friction benchmarks
   * Task-flow archetypes
   * Conversion & dropoff patterns by vertical

Participation in the marketplace is **opt-in, privacy-first, and revenue-shared**.
