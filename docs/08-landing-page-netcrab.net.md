# NetCrab Landing Page Spec

## Page Goals

* Make product people think:

  "Oh wow, we're wasting *so* much behavioral gold… and this looks easy and non-creepy."

* Drive:

  * "Book a demo" for product owners.

  * "Browse packs" for data buyers.

## Visual Concept

* Full-bleed hero illustration:

  * Deep ocean / fiber-optic network mashup.

  * A small hermit crab with an old beige PC tower as its shell, carrying glowing "data cubes" in its claws.

* Motion idea:

  * Subtle parallax where crab "scuttles" a few pixels on scroll.

## Section 1 – Hero

**Layout:**

* Left: Big headline + copy + CTA.

* Right: Hero illustration + tiny live "Friction Index" mock widget.

**Headline options:**

1. "Your network is dropping crumbs of gold. NetCrab picks them up."

2. "All those 'junk clicks' inside your product? We turn them into benchmarks and revenue."

**Subheadline:**

> NetCrab sits quietly inside your intranet, watches how people actually use your tools, and turns that behavior into clean product insights—and optional, anonymized data packs the whole industry learns from.

**Primary CTA:** `Get a Product Demo`

**Secondary CTA:** `Explore Data Packs`

Microcopy under CTA: "Friendly install. Privacy-first. You're always in control."

## Section 2 – How It Works (4 steps, echoing original stickies)

Visual: horizontal steps with small doodle icons.

1. **Collect**

   * "Drop in a lightweight SDK. A tiny crab starts listening for clicks, flows, and mistakes—without capturing personal details or text."

2. **Understand**

   * "NetCrab scores frustration and efficiency session by session, building a live map of where people glide and where they struggle."

3. **Improve**

   * "Your dashboard shows flows, hotspots, and AI summaries, so you can fix the worst parts first."

4. **(Optionally) Share & Earn**

   * "Opt in to privacy-safe, cross-industry benchmark packs. Your anonymous patterns join others to create valuable data—and you get paid your share."

## Section 3 – "What You Actually See"

3 cards with visuals:

1. **Friction Radar**

   * Caption: "Every screen ranked by user pain."

   * Mock screenshot: heatmap + list of top screens.

2. **Real User Flows**

   * Caption: "What people really do before and after your features."

3. **Crab Notes (AI Insights)**

   * Caption: "Short, honest summaries. No 40-page decks."

---

## Section 4 – For Product Teams & For Data Buyers

Split layout with two columns.

**Left: For Product & UX Teams**

* Bullet points:

  * "See frustration spikes within hours of each release."

  * "Quantify which UX pain points matter most."

  * "Give leadership benchmarks they can't ignore."

**Right: For Data Buyers**

* Bullet points:

  * "UX friction benchmarks across verticals."

  * "Task-flow archetypes at massive scale."

  * "Fresh behavioral data without invasive tracking."

CTA below: `Talk to Sales` (goes to shared funnel).

## Section 5 – Privacy & Ethics

* Headline: "Behavioral insight without creeping on individuals."

* 3 columns:

  * "No personal content or keystrokes."

  * "On-prem agent controls what leaves."

  * "Aggregated packs with minimum cohort sizes."

---

## Section 6 – Social Proof / Logos (Future)

* Placeholder: "Join the early NetCrab beta pod" with generic 'beta' badges.

---

## Section 7 – Footer

* Links: Product • Packs • Docs • Security • Contact.

* Tagline:

  > "NetCrab – humble little crab, gigantic understanding of what your users go through."
